# To do

Several improvements that can be made to `haskell-kubernetes` are as follows:

* Examples.
* Test and build with other versions of GHC.
* Generating ["classy"](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.13.1/docs/Control-Lens-TH.html) lenses
* neither the `client` nor `server` are configurable.
* Integration testing for the `client` and `server`.
* Improving (mock) server compile times.
* Upgrade to `servant-0.5` when released (will allow us to use `OPTIONS` and `HEAD`).
